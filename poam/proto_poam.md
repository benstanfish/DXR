# Proto-POAM Ideas

### Design Concerns
- Contract vehicle-related mentality
	- DBB
	- DB
- Funding source constraints
	- Host-Nation
	- MILCON
	- SRM
	- O&M
	- NAF
	- Other
- Cost Estimate Concerns
	- CWE exceeds PA by 10%
	- CWE under PA by...
- Long lead items 
- Spare parts
- Phasing
- Bid Options/CLINs
- GFCI or GFGI
- FF&E
- Special equipment installed
- Special equipment to build
- Waiver/exemptions: design requires UFC exemptions (planning premised on seeking UFC exceptions)
- J/As
	- Existing J/As
	- Expiration dates of J/As
	- Needed J/As
- Site approval requirements
- Utility conflicts
- Environmental concerns
- [[Code Triggers]]
	- Life Safety: UFC 1-200-01, Sec. 302.1.1: NFPA 101 compliance?
	- Seismic Assessment (30% UFC 3-301-01)
	- ATFP (cf. UFC 1-200-01, Sec. 302.2.3), 50%
	- Progressive Collapse (UFC 4-010-01)
	- Sustainability (cf. UFC 1-200-01, Sec. 302.2.2, Table 1-1 and Ch. 2)
	- Phasing (UFC 1-200-01, Sec. 3-3, 302.2.7 (cf. UFC 3-701-01))
	- Fire Protection:
		- UFC 1-200-01, 302.2.5 (50% replacement cost)
		- Sec. 3-8.2.1 (50% floor plan) or 3-8.3.1

### Performance Concerns
- Design Phases
	- Design submittals skipped (e.g. 35%, 65%, etc.)?
- Design Submittals
	- Rejected submissions
	- Delayed submissions
- Design Delays causing delay in acquistion schedule
	- During design
	- During bidder inquiry phase
- DQCP
	- No Design QC Plan
	- Rejected DQCP
	- A/E not adhering to DQCP
- Site Investigation Work and Safety Plan
- CPS (Construction Phase Services) contract
	- No CPS task order for A/E
	- Does project complexity warrent CPS?
- Reports of possible E/O

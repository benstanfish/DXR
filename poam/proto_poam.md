### Performance Concerns
- Design Phases
	- Design submittals skipped (e.g. 35%, 65%, etc.)?
- Design Submittals
	- Rejected submissions
	- Delayed submissions
- Design Delays causing delay in acquistion schedule
	- During design
	- During bidder inquiry phase
- DQCP
	- No Design QC Plan
	- Rejected DQCP
	- A/E not adhering to DQCP
- Site Investigation Work and Safety Plan
- CPS (Construction Phase Services) contract
	- No CPS task order for A/E
	- Does project complexity warrent CPS?
- Reports of possible E/O

# DXR

"DXR" stands for Dr Checks Review and referencing the initial impetus for this project: an app that can digest and summarize the review "conversations" for projects hosted in ProjNet.

The previous manefestation of this app was as a robust framework of Excel .bas modules. Given the limitations of the VBA language, assumed security concerns with "macros" and difficulty distributing .xlsm files a need for an alternative became apparent.
